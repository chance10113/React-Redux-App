SELF MADE INSTRUCTIONS!!!

Styling:
Set up a CSS Reset, create a "Central" box where picture will be displayed
    - Dark background for the overall page
Have a labeled button to click that causes random image to appear 

Using Lorem Picsum for api

If fancy, can create component that allows for custom sizing of the image, or adding blur/grayscale to it
    - For now, just use component for rendering image
        -- component != form
